This folder contains simple programs written in various languages to help students set up and run computer experiments 
in relation with material covered mainly in the "Analytical Mechanics" course.
1) pendulum*.m : simple velocity Verlet time integration of the equation of motion of a plane pendulum. There is no restriction
                 on the energy, that is on the maximum angle theta. One can either plot the angle as a function of time, the
                 phase space trajectory, or both.
